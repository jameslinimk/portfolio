# Portfolio

## Check it out [here](https://www.jamesalin.com)

This is my portfolio website, showcasing a little bit about me, and some of my projects. Has a space theme in the background, with planets, stars, and a space station.

Written in SvelteKit, Tailwind, and Three3s, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

When you click on a project, it will take you to a page with more information about the project (the github README), and a link to the source code.
